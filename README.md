A command line utility to convert [Org](https://orgmode.org) files to customizable [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) invoice and work logs. This project is currently hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/samwise_i/orgtoinvoice).

# Why

I was spending way too much time fiddling with invoices and work logs so I automated the process. Plus, everyone needs a GitLab project:-)

# Design Philosophy

The source code of **OrgToInvoice** should be **_readable_**, **_concise_** and **_efficient_**, leveraging other applications (**org-mode, texi2pdf**) when practically feasible. I prefer short functions focusing on one task which the input and output types are clearly specified. I mostly prefer composition (has-a) over inheritance (is-a), because inheritance is often overused leading to undue complexity. Templated code is used, but was kept as simple as possible but no simpler:-)

The architecture should be layered: the lower levels are mostly composed of primitive operations. Data structures are used providing flexibility. At the higher levels, there should be a simple API which is easy to understand. Thought was given to algorithm efficiency and avoiding unnecessary memory allocations when possible.

# Org Input Data

All time entries from the `.org` file shall have the following format:

  ```
  CLOCK: [2017-02-14 Tue 13:16]--[2017-02-14 Tue 15:22] =>  2:06
  ...
  CLOCK: [2017-02-14 Tue 17:14]--[2017-02-14 Tue 18:15] =>  1:01
  ` Worked with Elon on creating a release candidate and running the torture test.
  ```

The **CLOCK:** lines are auto generated by org-mode using the built-in clock functionality. There may be one or more of these clock lines per comment describing what was done for that period(s). Note, comment lines must start with ``` ` ``` and follow one or more valid clock lines.

Work days can be entered in any order since they are sorted when read.

All comments are required to start with one of the following:
  ```
  `   Normal work
  ~   Meeting (Not implemented)
  ^   Travel  (Not implemented)
  ```

# Configuration

An `.ini` file must be created containing provider and client information. This information will be used to populate various fields of the invoice and worklog.

  ```
  [PROVIDER]
      Company = "Awesome Engineering, Inc."
      Address1 = "10 Where stuff gets done circle"
      City = "TheCity"
      State =  "CA"
      ZIP =  "94103"
      Phone = "415.555.1212"

  [CLIENT]
      Company = "ACME Systems, Inc."
      Address1 = "18 Cool Project Street"
      City = "Utopia"
      State =  "TX"
      ZIP =  "78653"
      Phone = "520.555.1212"
      PO = "12345"
      Rate = "167.26"
      Terms = "Net 14"

  # Comment 
  [INVOICE]
      Footer = "Thank you for your business:)"

  [LOG]
      Orientation = "Landscape"
  ```

# Usage

### Python Script

Reports can be generated by using the included **_generate-inv.py_** script which will prompt the user for input instead of having to enter values on the command line. The script can be found in the **_example-data_** directory.
    
  `└> Python3 ./generate-inv.py`

### Command Line

Running the application is fairly straightforward. Once the application is built it can be executed with this command `bin/orgtoinv ...options...`

Certain options are required. You MUST provide:

  ```
  -t [input file name] of .org
  -c [input file name] of .ini <OR> NOT needed if .ini has the same base name as the .org file e.g. (customer.org, customer.ini)
  -i [invoice number]
  -m [month]
  -p [Pay period] <OR> -b [day] <AND> -e [day]
  ```

Here are the supported options:

  ```
  --time     | -t [input file]       .org input file with time data
  --config   | -c [input file]       .ini configuration file, defaults to same filename as time data if not specified
  --month    | -m [month]            Month 1-12 
  --year     | -y [year]             Year, defaults to current year if NOT specified
  --bday     | -b [day of month]     Start day of pay period, NOT used if pay period specified
  --eday     | -e [day of month]     End day of pay period, NOT used if pay period specified
  --period   | -p [1-2]              Pay period either 1 or 2
  --PO       | -o [PO number]        Purchase order number, if NOT specified none will be printed on invoice
  --rate     | -r [dollars/hour]     Hourly rate, this OVERRIDES the config.ini
  --fbase    | -f [base filename]    Override filename generation. Used when driven by a script
  --speriods | -s                    List pay periods
  --ledger   | -l                    Generate a ledger entry
  --help     | -h                    This output
  --verbose  | -v                    Verbose output
  ```

The following is a typical usage example:

  `└> bin/orgtoinv --PO 314159 --invoice 42 --month 02 --period 1 --year 2017 --time  ../example-data/customer.org -v`

  ```
  2017-02-01     2.95 Fixed a lookup table problem, product issue 232
  2017-02-06     1.22 Tested FPGA firmware on various Cray setups looking for black SOD
  2017-02-07     7.45 Looking at failure on Cray restart, investigated customer AlwaysPaysOnTime problem 
  2017-02-08     1.92 Worked JimBob and CutAndPasteHero testing new firmware. Prelim analysis of the Cray restart issue.
  2017-02-09     7.55 FPGA ver issue and Cray restart issue, tested possible fix for restart issues
  2017-02-10     8.97 Fixed issue with updater locking, UniqueID tweak
  2017-02-14     3.12 Worked with Elon creating a release candidate and running torture tests
       Total    33.18

  Output written to : customer-0042.Feb-1-14-2017
  ```

This produces two files which are written to the same directory as the source file(s):

  ```
  customer-0042.Feb-1-14-2021.tex
  customer-0042.Feb-1-14-2021.log.tex
  ```
    
# Converting to PDF

The invoice and log files are in LaTeX format and will likely need to be converted to pdf or some other document format. On Linux systems the **_texi2pdf_** utility from [texinfo](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/) can be used to generate the pdfs.

  `texi2pdf customer-0042.Feb-1-14-2021.log.tex`

A [Ledger](https://plaintextaccounting.org) file is also produced for use with the Ledger plain text accounting system.

  `customer-0042.Feb-1-14-2021.leg`

# Examples

The **_example-data_** directory contains an example run. The reports were generated by running `test.sh`, and then converting the `.tex` files to pdfs using **_texi2pdf_**. You can also use the Python3 script to generate the examples.

# Customization

The reports are somewhat customizable by editing `invoice-color.tex` and `worklog-color.tex` found in the **_example-data_** directory. Currently, this requires some knowledge of LaTeX. The actual report writer interfaces are found int `src/invoice.h` and `src/worklog.h`.

# Building

OrgToInvoice has the following dependencies:
- A C++20 compatible compiler either GCC 11 or Clang 13 or newer
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.15 or newer. 

To build:

  ```
  git clone git@gitlab.com:samwise_i/orgtoinvoice.git
  cd orgtoinvoice
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  ```

The build artifact will be placed in the project local **_bin/_** directory.
